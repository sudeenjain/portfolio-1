# Aniketh N K | AIML Engineer Portfolio

## 🚀 Overview

This is the personal portfolio website for **Aniketh N K**, an aspiring **AI & Machine Learning Engineer** and **Cloud Enthusiast**.

The design is modern, cyber-themed, featuring a dark mode aesthetic with vibrant cyan/violet accents and a dynamic, low-poly particle background implemented with **Three.js**. The structure is highly modular, making it easy to maintain and update each section independently.

## ✨ Features

* **Cyberpunk/Dark Mode Design:** A sleek, high-contrast visual style utilizing glass-like effects (`glassmorphism`) and neon colors.
* **Dynamic Three.js Background:** A unique, interactive 3D particle animation runs in the background for an immersive experience.
* **Modular Structure:** The project is split into multiple HTML fragments (`includes/`), CSS (`css/style.css`), and JavaScript files (`js/particles.js`, `js/scripts.js`) for easy management.
* **Responsive Layout:** Fully optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
* **Scroll Animations:** Uses the **AOS (Animate On Scroll)** library to bring elements to life as the user scrolls.
* **Formspree Integration:** Includes a functional contact form ready to be connected to a Formspree endpoint for message relay.
